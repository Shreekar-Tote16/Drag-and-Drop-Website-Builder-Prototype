# Drag-and-Drop Website Builder (Prototype)

## Overview
This project is a **functional prototype** of a drag-and-drop website builder.  
It was built as part of an evaluation assignment for Websites.co.in.  

The builder allows users to:
- Fill out a form with their website details (name, domain, email).
- Access a drag-and-drop interface to design their website.
- Drag elements (text, buttons, shapes) onto a canvas.
- Edit properties (content, colors, styles) via a properties panel.
- Delete elements and adjust their layering (z-index).
- Works across desktop and mobile (responsive).
